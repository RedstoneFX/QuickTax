# this is a global enable/disable option for all schedules (and is of the highest priority)
# if this is false, none of the schedules will run even if they are enabled in their own sections
enabled: false

# if true and there are schedules enabled, they will automatically run on server start or plugin reload
# otherwise it will only start with the schedule start command
autostart: false

################################## VERY IMPORTANT NOTES ########################################################
# users unsure of the schedule config are advised to try this on a test server before actual use
# catastrophic damage can be done to the server economy if you accidentally set tax collections to be done every second!
# read through the entire schedule config carefully before use, including the examples!

# you should always enable and start a collection task within a 24-hour window of your intended first run because
# specifying the start date/month for the first run of a collection is not supported
# in other words, DO NOT enable and run the schedule more than 24 hours before your intended start year/month/date/time

# to those who wonder why date/month is not supported, it adds a lot more confusion for players who may treat it
# as a repeating month/date - should you still be confused on how to schedule long term tasks, please contact me on
# discord at: FrozenFever#8284

# a full wiki will be written to better explain all these in the near future

# you may use other unique names for your own schedules
schedules:
  # example1 shows how to repeat a tax collection from all players daily at 12 midnight from GMT+8 timezone
  example1:
    # whether to use this schedule - note that if schedules are globally disabled this value will be ignored
    enabled: false

    # whether to start repeating the task from a fixed time
    # if true, will begin running the task the next time the clock reaches the timestamp configured below

    # if false, the repeating task will start count from every plugin load/server start
    # note that false is not recommended in most situations (better to specify exact timings for easier management)
    startFromFixedTime: true
    # timings below (24-hour format) are ignored if startFromFixedTime is set to false
    # a list of supported timezone is provided at the end of the config

    # which tax command to run (collectall, collectrank or collectbal)
